## Airbnb Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings using various data visualization and regression modeling techniques. The aim is to extract valuable insights from the data, such as trends in booking amounts, factors affecting guest satisfaction, the impact of location on pricing, and how different room types and capacities influence bookings. The project also explores ways to handle outliers, improve the quality of the data, and build effective regression models for price prediction.

The initial analysis was conducted in Excel. We're now trying to resolve most complex issues like outliers to optimize model performance with python.
Please Take a look at the metadata file to explore all the features and the dashboard section on Excel file to explore the report analysis. 

### Methodology

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

    * The dataset was first inspected for missing values and outliers.
    * Categorical variables like room_type and cities were encoded to facilitate machine learning models.
    * Continuous variables such as booking_amount were examined for skewness, and necessary transformations were applied (e.g., log transformation).
    * The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    * Visualization Techniques:
        * Boxplots were used to explore the distribution of key numerical variables (e.g., booking amounts) and to identify outliers.
        * Scatter plots and line plots were used to examine relationships between booking amounts and features such as room_type, number_of_bedrooms, person_capacity, and distance from the city center.
        * Heatmaps were used to visualize correlations between variables and to identify important factors affecting pricing.
        * The distribution of booking amounts across various cities was analyzed through bar charts to compare average prices.

3. Handling Outliers

    * Multiple methods were considered for handling outliers, such as:
        * Winsorization (capping extreme values),
        * Log transformation (to reduce skewness),
        * Removing outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR), and
        * Using robust models that are less sensitive to outliers (e.g., Huber Regression).
    * The best approach was determined based on model performance and the nature of the data.

4. Regression Modeling

    * Linear Regression was used as a baseline to predict the booking amount.
    * Ridge and Lasso Regression (regularized models) were applied to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity.
    * Tree-based models such as Random Forest and XGBoost were explored to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
    * Cross-validation and Grid Search were used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
    * Evaluation metrics such as R-squared, MAE, and RMSE were used to assess the accuracy of the models.

5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

    * Feature importance was analyzed in tree-based models to understand which features have the largest impact on predicting booking amounts.
    * SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to interpret model predictions and provide insight into how each feature contributed to the final predictions.

### Conclusion

The analysis provided several valuable insights:
* Room types and location were significant factors in determining booking amounts. Cities like Amsterdam and Paris had the highest average booking amounts, while cities like Athens had lower booking prices but higher guest satisfaction.
* Person capacity and the number of bedrooms also had a strong influence on pricing, with larger capacities and more bedrooms generally leading to higher booking amounts.
* Proximity to attractions and distance from city centers were crucial factors affecting booking amounts, with properties closer to key locations commanding higher prices.

### Future Work

* Further model refinement and feature engineering can be done by incorporating additional external data (e.g., seasonality, local events).
* Exploring deep learning techniques for more complex prediction models.
* Integrating real-time data for dynamic pricing predictions.
